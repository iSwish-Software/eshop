# 0001: Record architecture decisions

Date: 2022-09-25

## Status

Accepted

## Context

We want to keep track of the key decisions made in this project so that we know the motivation behind the decisions.

## Decision

We will use Michael Nygard's [Lightweight Architecture Decision Records](https://cognitect.com/blog/2011/11/15/documenting-architecture-decisions) to log the key decisions.

## Consequences

The decision records will become an important part of the system documentation and will be a starting point for new stakeholders. To avoid drift, the decision records will need to be continually maintained as new decisions are made and old decisions are changed.
